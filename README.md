This is a repo for openly sharing datasets of historical events and lives in a simple CSV format. 

It is intended for use with *historicaldate*, a Python package for handling events and lives with possibly uncertain dates and displaying timelines of them. For example dates may be specified as a year, or with a 'circa' indication or as a range of possible dates. See the ReadMe at https://github.com/dh3968mlq/historicaldate for details.

There are some example timelines at https://historicaldate.com/

It is at present a personal repo, with inevitable limitations on the amount of data held. Contributions would be most welcome, within the data guidelines below, either via pull requests or emails to david@historicaldate.com. I would be very happy for this repo to become an openly shared resource with wider contributions.

### Data guidelines

   * It's an English language database
   * Dates and files are in *historicaldate* format
   * Information is freely available
   * Almost all rows contain a link in the *url* column to a relevant entry English Wikipedia
